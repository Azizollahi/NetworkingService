Potential Next Steps ðŸš€

The current application is a great foundation, but it's not yet a feature-complete, production-ready system. Here are some of the most common directions we could go from here:

1. Expanding SOCKS Protocol Support:

SOCKS5 Authentication: Implement the "Username/Password" authentication method.

More SOCKS5 Commands: Add support for BIND (for active FTP) and UDP ASSOCIATE (for UDP traffic).

SOCKS4a Support: Implement the SOCKS4a extension to allow clients to connect via domain names.

Enable SSL for TCP Connections: Implement SSL/TLS support for secure TCP connections.

Add ability to receive on one port and send on another port. And should be able to choose for client or the remote server we are connecting them to: This would allow for more flexible routing scenarios.

2. Implementing the Financial Router (ISO 8583):

This is the next major feature we discussed. We would build the Iso8583Handler, the IRoutingService, and the IDownstreamConnectionManager for connection pooling.

3. Adding Security and Business Rules:

Access Control: Use the file-based IRepository we designed to create rules for allowing or denying connections based on IP addresses.

User Management: For SOCKS5 authentication, we could store user credentials in a JSON file and manage them via the repository.

4. Production Hardening:

Advanced Logging: Integrate a library like Serilog for structured logging to make diagnostics easier.

Resource Management: Implement connection limits and timeouts to prevent resource exhaustion.

API for Management: Use the WebHost project to add API endpoints for viewing active connections or reloading configuration on the fly.
