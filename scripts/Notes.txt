Potential Next Steps ðŸš€

1. Complete SOCKS4 Support
2. User Management: For SOCKS5 authentication, we could store user credentials in a JSON file and manage them via the repository.
3. Access Control: Use the file-based IRepository we designed to create rules for allowing or denying connections based on IP addresses.
4. Resource Management: Implement connection limits and timeouts to prevent resource exhaustion.
5. Advanced Logging: Integrate a library like Serilog for structured logging to make diagnostics easier.
6. Private Network Support (NAT)
7. Private DNS for local domain resolutions
8. Tunneling Capabilities (New Module): Implement the ability to tunnel from a specific port to another port, allowing for more flexible routing scenarios. in this new module we should be able to have one-way and split connection mode for both client side and remote server side.
9. GSSAPI Authentication: Implement GSSAPI for secure authentication, especially useful in enterprise environments.
10. Distributed Design: Consider a distributed architecture where multiple instances of the SOCKS server can be deployed.
11. API for Management: Use the WebHost project to add API endpoints for viewing active connections or reloading configuration on the fly.
12. Blazor Server for Admin UI: Create a Blazor Server application to provide a web-based admin interface for managing the SOCKS server, viewing logs, and monitoring connections.
