Potential Next Steps ðŸš€

1. Complete SOCKS4 Support
2. User Management: For SOCKS5 authentication, we could store user credentials in a JSON file and manage them via the repository.
3. Access Control: Use the file-based IRepository we designed to create rules for allowing or denying connections based on IP addresses.
4. Private Network Support (NAT)
5. Private DNS for local domain resolutions
6. Resource Management: Implement connection limits and timeouts to prevent resource exhaustion.
7. GSSAPI Authentication: Implement GSSAPI for secure authentication, especially useful in enterprise environments.
8. Advanced Logging: Integrate a library like Serilog for structured logging to make diagnostics easier.
9. Tunneling Capabilities: Implement the ability to tunnel from a specific port to another port, allowing for more flexible routing scenarios. in this new module we should be able to have one-way and split connection mode for both client side and remote server side.
10. Distributed Design: Consider a distributed architecture where multiple instances of the SOCKS server can be deployed.
11. API for Management: Use the WebHost project to add API endpoints for viewing active connections or reloading configuration on the fly.
12. Blazor Server for Admin UI: Create a Blazor Server application to provide a web-based admin interface for managing the SOCKS server, viewing logs, and monitoring connections.
